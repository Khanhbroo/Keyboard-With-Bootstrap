# ClickCraft ðŸŽ›

ClickCraft is a modern, responsive website designed to showcase and sell high-quality mechanical keyboards. Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, it offers users a seamless experience to explore various keyboard categories, learn about the company, read testimonials, and get in touch via a contact form.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, from desktops to mobile phones, using Bootstrap's grid system and custom media queries.
- **Navigation Bar**: Easy access to sections like Home, About Us, Keyboards, Product, and Contact.
- **Product Showcase**: A Bootstrap carousel slider displaying keyboard categories (TKL, Full-Size, Compact) with descriptions and images.
- **Testimonials**: Client feedback with star ratings presented in a carousel to build trust.
- **Contact Form**: A functional form for users to send messages directly from the website.
- **Custom Styling**: Unique design with CSS, including hover effects, animations, and a sleek dark theme with orange and blue accents.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For custom styling, layout, and animations, with a separate responsive CSS file for media queries.
- **Bootstrap 5.3.3**: For responsive design and components like the navbar, carousel, cards, and form.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used throughout the website (e.g., arrows, stars).
